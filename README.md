# landing-page
A simple landing page layout to practice my css skills.

Author: Andrew Erasmus
What I hope to achieve with this project is to build the layout of a web application and solidy some of the skills I have learnt in CSS. This project is used to test and confirm my css and html skills so that I can continue on to learn JavaScript in the future.
